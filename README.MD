# net-flip (Work in Progress - NOT USEFUL ATM)

**net-flip** is an ultra-fast, optimally engineered HTTP server built with performance and integration in mind. Designed specifically for use with Node.js, net-flip delivers industry-leading speed by leveraging cutting-edge system technologies and optimizing every layer of communication between the server and JavaScript control logic.

**Note:** This project is currently under development.

## Roadmap
- [x] Initialize project
- [ ] C - Dynamic Binary Stream
- [ ] C - Main Event loop
- [ ] C - Task Management system
- [ ] C - IO Management
- [ ] C - Library API
- [ ] NodeJS - API to native lib

## Why net-flip is the Fastest HTTP Server

### Minimal Overhead in JavaScript Communication
- **Shared Memory Bytes:**  
  net-flip uses shared memory bytes to exchange data between the underlying server and Node.js. This technique virtually eliminates the overhead typically encountered when crossing the language boundary, resulting in near-zero latency.

### Linux Optimizations with io_uring
- **State-of-the-Art Socket Manipulation:**  
  Leveraging the Linux `io_uring` API, net-flip can perform highly efficient socket operations. This modern interface allows for optimal asynchronous I/O processing, drastically reducing system call overhead and achieving unprecedented throughput.

### Future-Ready Features
- **Upcoming Enhancements:**  
  While our current focus is on blazing-fast HTTP communication, net-flip is designed with extensibility in mind. Planned future features include:
    - **SSL/TLS Support:** Secure communication without sacrificing performance.
    - **HTTP/2 Integration:** Advanced protocol features and improved resource management for modern web applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version X.X.X or higher)
- **Linux Operating System:** net-flip takes full advantage of Linux's io_uring, so a recent Linux distribution is required.

### Installation

You can install net-flip via npm:

    npm install net-flip

Or clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/net-flip.git
    cd net-flip
    npm install

### Basic Usage

Below is a simple example of how to set up and run the net-flip server:

    const netFlip = require('net-flip');

    const server = netFlip.createServer({
      port: 8080,
      // Additional configuration options can be added here
    });

    server.on('request', (req, res) => {
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
      res.end('Hello from net-flip!');
    });

    server.listen(() => {
      console.log('net-flip server is running on port 8080');
    });

## Performance Highlights

- **Ultra-low latency:** Thanks to direct shared memory communication with JavaScript.
- **High throughput:** Optimized socket handling via io_uring on Linux.
- **Scalability:** Designed from the ground up to handle large numbers of concurrent connections with minimal overhead.
